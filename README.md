## Hi, I‚Äôm Patrick üëã

### About me
At work, I am a Full Stack Developer for a **K-12 School Board in Ontario, Canada** ‚Äî working remotely. I often find myself wearing many hats. Typically you‚Äôll find me juggling my Full Stack role with DBA, Sysadmin, DevOps, among others...

When I am not working you‚Äôll find me hanging out with my Wife and two dogs, Bear and Teddy. If the weather is warm you will catch me out for a tour in the twistys on my motorcycle ‚Äî I recently picked up a 2018 Triumph Street Triple RS 765!

I enjoy tinkering on wood working projects in the garage, ranging from little things like cutting boards, wood signs, etc. ‚Äî all the way up to full-on furniture, like tables, desks (like the one my keyboard is on right now).

### Work Stuff

I‚Äôve logged over **10+ years** in the tech industry, with a large portion of that being in the Education sector (K-12 and Post Secondary). I have worked both in Teams, and alone; on large projects and small projects.

### My Current Stack

Most of the time nowadays you‚Äôll find me using the **TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine JS, Laravel, and Livewire)**. It‚Äôs fast, scalable, and allows for rapid development and prototyping of ideas. If I need to script something, it‚Äôs either Powershell or Bash, depending on which OS I am using.

I‚Äôve deployed apps to on-prem servers, Azure app service, Docker, and for rapid development I use services like [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) to get something up fast and easy.

For the most part I try to at least stay in touch with the current trends, so I will often dabble in new tech or frameworks just to get a sense for what‚Äôs out there. Well written docs make it so easy to jump into something new and get up-to-speed quickly (I‚Äôm looking at you Laravel‚Ä¶).

I‚Äôve started looking into open source projects I can contribute to in my spare time, as well I have a couple ideas floating around that I think would make for potential packages that I'd like to develop. I‚Äôve also committed myself to start blogging! (more about that soon‚Ä¶).
