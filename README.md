# Hi! I'm Patrick 👋

## TL;DR

Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience. Modern PHP (Laravel) focused, with a strong foundation in databases and infrastructure. I care about clean code, performance, and building reliable systems.

## About

I work remotely from Ontario, Canada and build web applications and integrations ranging from small tools to large platforms. My work often involves APIs, third-party services, optimization, and automation. More recently I've been involved in integrating various AI solutions into the products I work with.

Tech I use frequently: Laravel, Livewire, TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, Docker, Redis, MySQL/MSSQL, and AWS.
