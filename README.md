# Hi! I'm Patrick 👋

## TLDR
I'm a seasoned Full-Stack Software Engineer with 13+ years of tech experience, specializing in PHP, APIs, and process efficiency. Passionate about coding, motorcycling, and family. Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pjkellar), or [email](mailto:pjkellar@gmail.com), and check out my insights on [patrickkellar.dev](https://patrickkellar.dev/).

## About Me
I'm a Senior-Level Full-Stack Software Engineer working remotely from Ontario, Canada. My journey in the tech industry has taken me from Systems Admin, to Database Admin, and now to Software Engineering, resulting in over 13 years of rich, varied experience with a strong foundation of computer science principals. I believe in simplicity and elegance when it comes to writing and designing software. 🚀

🧰 PHP is where I am most comfortable. Over the years I've honed skills in an array of technologies, more than I can list here. A few of the more recent ones are: TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire (The TALL Stack), Vue, React (more specifically Next.js), Docker, Git, Azure, AWS, Laravel Vapor, Redis, MSSQL, MySQL, Powershell, and Javascript/Typescript. Whether it's Windows, MacOS, or Linux, I'm at home on any platform.

💻 My expertise extends to designing and building APIs, syncing with third-party APIs, integrating AI into software processes, and building identity automation solutions for school boards. I've developed both internal tools and public-facing applications. I consider security to be a top priority. I'm driven by my passion for automation and efficiency - for me, there's no greater satisfaction than perfecting a system's workflow!

🎯 I've navigated significant projects and am always ready to embrace the next challenge. I'm also excitedly considering an exploration into GO or Rust, considering all the hype I'm seeing around them.

☕️ When I need a break from the screen, you'll often find me chasing the horizon on my motorcycle. I've recently picked up a '18 Triumph Street Triple RS, there's just something about that triple cylinder engine whistle that makes my heart happy. Although I'm not racing on the Isle of Man, there's nothing like a spirited ride to unwind and reset. Speaking of unwinding and resetting, I love to spend time with my Wife and our two dogs, Bear and Teddy.
